For example, an entity can produce 4 units of Item A or 10 units of Item B. If the entity focused entirely on Item B, the opportunity cost would be the 4 units of Item A that the entity could have made instead.

( As an aside, the entity could put any ratio into A or B, 75% to A and 25% to B for example, but then the opportunity cost would be 1 unit of A and 7.5 units of B. )"

For example, an entity can spend 35 resources to produce an Item A or 70 resources to produce an Item B. If the entity focused entirely on Item B, the opportunity cost would be the 2 units of Item A that the entity could have made instead."
	,"comparative_advantage": "The condition in which an entity has a lower opportunity cost than another entity to produce a good."
